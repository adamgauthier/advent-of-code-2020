# Advent of Code 2020

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

This repository houses my solutions for the 2020 Advent of Code event. See [the official website](https://adventofcode.com/2020) for more information.

## Motivation

I use Advent of Code mostly to get familiar with languages which I have always wanted to learn or experiment with but never had a specific project in mind for. This is a fun way to keep up with modern languages that I don't get to use in my day to day life! I usually get busy with other things and don't manage to complete the entire calendar, we'll see what happens this year!
